    description:
      "Aquaproof Crystalline, an integral crystalline waterproofing compound, is added to the concrete or mortar mix at the time of batching. The active chemicals react with the moisture in fresh concrete and with the by-products of cement hydration to cause a catalytic reaction, which generates a non-soluble crystalline formation throughout the pores and capillary tracts of the concrete. Thus, Aquaproof Crystalline reduces water permeability of concrete structures which can allow it to be used in place of various surface applied waterproofing membranes systems. This product also has a self-healing property under presence of moisture and can heal cracks up to 0.5 mm. Aquaproof Crystalline can be used as an applied coating, mixed to a slurry consistency with potable water.",
